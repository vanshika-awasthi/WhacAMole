**_🎮 Mario-Themed Whac-A-Mole Game_**

A fun and interactive Mario-themed Whac-A-Mole game built with Java using the Swing and AWT libraries. This project is perfect for beginner Java programmers looking to explore GUI development.

**Features:**
- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** created with Java Swing 🎨.
- **Click handlers** to "whack" moles 🦠 and avoid piranha plants 🌱.
- Randomized mole and piranha spawning using **Timer** and **Random** ⏱️🎲.
- A **restart button** to reset the game 🔄.
- **High score tracking** and display for added challenge 🏆.
- **JButtons** for tiles to interact with the game and make it more dynamic 🔲.

**What I Learned:**
- Hands-on experience with **event handling**, **animations**, and basic **game mechanics** in Java 💻.
- Exploring GUI components like **JButtons** and **Timers** to make the game interactive 🖱️.

Enjoyed the challenge of working on this small-scale project and learned a lot along the way 🎉.
I hope you enjoy playing and exploring this game as much as I enjoyed building it! I'm open to contributions and ideas to make this project even better 🤝.
